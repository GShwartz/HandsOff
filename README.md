## A small and free solution for IT & HD specialists. ##

### The Idea ###
Do you love your job but hate the custumer's <b>technophobic</b> nature and unwillingness to cooperate? <br />
<b>ME TOO!</b> <br /><br />
This is where <b>HandsOff</b> comes in. <br />
The entire idea behind this solution is that the other side only holds the <b>phone</b> and nothing else<br />
You can also perform maintenance on the remote station and update the station's client remotely.
* Since this is a pet project I don't have any steady hosting space to hold the exe files so I added a feature <br />
  that allows you to manually enter the new download url which will be published here. <br />
