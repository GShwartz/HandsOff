## A small and free solution for IT & HD specialists. ##

### The Idea ###
Do you love your job but hate the custumer's <b>technophobic</b> nature and unwillingness to cooperate? <br />
<b>ME TOO!</b> <br /><br />
This is where <b>HandsOff</b> comes in.
The entire idea behind this solution is that the other side only holds the <b>phone</b> and nothing else<br />
(Future add-ons will include locking the client's mouse and keyboard while you handle the tech issue).
